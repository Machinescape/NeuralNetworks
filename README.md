# NeuralNetworks

A replication and refitting for Amazon AWS of the work done by jean et al.

This involves the use of a pre-trained deep neural network and ridge regression to predict areas of poverty within a country.

I have documented the first pass work done in jupyter notebooks with the others done in AWS sagemaker.
